## 2024-05-22 - Micro-optimization in `tas_dna_pilot.py`
**Learning:** Replacing `defaultdict` with `dict` + pre-initialization yielded 2.5x speedup in micro-benchmarks for dictionary access. However, absolute gain is small for small N. Reviewers highlight safety risks (`KeyError`) when removing `defaultdict`, emphasizing the need for strict validation (which `admit_patient` provides).
**Action:** Always ensure strict validation exists before replacing `defaultdict` with `dict` for performance. Document the validation clearly to reassure reviewers.

## 2024-05-23 - Micro-optimization in `tas_dna_pilot.py` loops
**Learning:** For very small loops (N=3) in Python, avoiding `zip()` and overhead of generator expressions or temporary list creation is faster than "idiomatic" optimizations. Also, removing explicit dict key checks in favor of `try-except KeyError` yielded ~18% speedup in `admit_patient` because valid keys are the 99.9% case.
**Action:** When optimizing tight loops with small N, prefer simple indexing or direct access over functional constructs. Use EAFP (Ask Forgiveness) for dictionary lookups on hot paths where failure is rare.

## 2026-02-15 - The Sentient Lock
**Learning:** Treat performance optimizations as 'privileges' earned by strict, enforceable input verification. This principle transforms performance from a raw goal into a conditional outcome of correctness.
**Action:** When optimizing a hot path, create a specific 'Sentient Lock' test that verifies both the optimization (e.g., EAFP) and the safety invariant (e.g., ValueError on invalid input). This ensures no future optimization can bypass the necessary validation.

## 2026-10-24 - Integer Arithmetic Speedup
**Learning:** In Python, replacing `int(amount * (pool / total))` with `(amount * pool) // total` yields a ~2.4x speedup by avoiding float conversion and division overhead. This is valid when inputs are integers and the logic is simple proportional allocation.
**Action:** Prefer integer arithmetic over float arithmetic for allocation logic when precision requirements allow (floor division).
