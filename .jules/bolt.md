## 2024-05-22 - Micro-optimization in `tas_dna_pilot.py`
**Learning:** Replacing `defaultdict` with `dict` + pre-initialization yielded 2.5x speedup in micro-benchmarks for dictionary access. However, absolute gain is small for small N. Reviewers highlight safety risks (`KeyError`) when removing `defaultdict`, emphasizing the need for strict validation (which `admit_patient` provides).
**Action:** Always ensure strict validation exists before replacing `defaultdict` with `dict` for performance. Document the validation clearly to reassure reviewers.

## 2024-05-23 - Micro-optimization in `tas_dna_pilot.py` loops
**Learning:** For very small loops (N=3) in Python, avoiding `zip()` and overhead of generator expressions or temporary list creation is faster than "idiomatic" optimizations. Also, removing explicit dict key checks in favor of `try-except KeyError` yielded ~18% speedup in `admit_patient` because valid keys are the 99.9% case.
**Action:** When optimizing tight loops with small N, prefer simple indexing or direct access over functional constructs. Use EAFP (Ask Forgiveness) for dictionary lookups on hot paths where failure is rare.

## 2026-02-15 - The Sentient Lock
**Learning:** Treat performance optimizations as 'privileges' earned by strict, enforceable input verification. This principle transforms performance from a raw goal into a conditional outcome of correctness.
**Action:** When optimizing a hot path, create a specific 'Sentient Lock' test that verifies both the optimization (e.g., EAFP) and the safety invariant (e.g., ValueError on invalid input). This ensures no future optimization can bypass the necessary validation.

## 2024-05-24 - Optimizing `phoenix_protocol` bulk rollback
**Learning:** For bulk rollbacks (e.g., reverting large lists of actions), iteratively `pop()`ing and updating counts is slow ($O(K)$ Python loop overhead). Replacing it with `collections.Counter` and `itertools.islice` shifts the workload to C-optimized internals, achieving ~3x speedup for $N=1,000,000$. Additionally, `del list[start:]` is much faster than full slice copies for in-place truncation. To ensure correctness, the unconditional total slice length `(len(history) - attested_length)` must be used to calculate `total_patients` updates.
**Action:** Always favor `itertools` and `collections` (like `Counter` and `islice`) to aggregate bulk list operations rather than iterating in Python, particularly for operations simulating large transactional rollbacks.

## 2026-05-25 - Optimizing global invariant checks in `rss_01_simulation.py`
**Learning:** Global invariant checks that compare an entity against all others can often be optimized from O(N) per agent (potentially O(N²) overall) to O(1) per agent. By identifying the mathematical property required for the invariant (e.g., checking if *any* agent exceeds a threshold is equivalent to checking if the *top* agents exceed it), you can pre-calculate the extrema (like the top 2 max values via `heapq.nlargest`) once per step and pass only those to the agents.
**Action:** When writing or reviewing global constraint checks (like the Stewardship Invariant), look for opportunities to pre-calculate the required mathematical extrema at the system level instead of performing full linear scans within each agent's decision loop.
